# SnapSort - Uncover Forgotten Moments

SnapSort helps you organize and extract personal photos from large, mixed-content drives with intelligent filtering and robust processing. The script automatically sorts images by date while avoiding system files and application images, making it perfect for recovering memories from old hard drives or organizing large photo collections.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üìÖ Date-based Photo Organization
SnapSort automatically organizes your images into a clean folder structure based on when they were taken. The script reads EXIF data from your photos to determine the actual capture date, falling back to file modification dates when EXIF data isn't available. Your photos are sorted into year/month/day folders, making it easy to find specific memories.

### üß† Intelligent Filtering System
The script includes filtering to ensure you only get actual photos, not system icons, application images or thumbnails. It automatically skips system folders and filters out small images that are likely thumbnails or icons. SnapSort also defaults to filtering out images less than 600x600 pixels or 50 KB, but allows you to flexibly choose these values. If enabled, SnapSort will save a CSV file that allows you to manually review SnapSort's decision on a file-by-file basis. This allows you to force process images that SnapSort misclassified.

**Supported image formats:**
SnapSort supports all image formats; just add the extension to the list at the top of '''photo_organizer.py''' before running it! However by default, the following image formats are considered:
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.cr2`, `.nef`, `.arw`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.rw2`, `.orf`, `.dng`, `.heic`, `.heif`

The script prioritizes images with EXIF data from cameras and smartphones but will also include large, high-resolution images even without EXIF data. For EXIF extraction, it uses `piexif`/Pillow for JPEG/TIFF files and falls back to `exiftool` for other formats or when EXIF is missing.

### ‚è≥ Progress Tracking
During operation, SnapSort provides real-time feedback with an animated spinner during initialization and detailed progress indicators during processing. The inline progress display shows:
- Number of files processed, copied, skipped, and errors
- Estimated time remaining

All operations are logged comprehensively. The detailed log file records every copied file with source, destination, and size information, every skipped file with explanations, plus errors and summary statistics. This makes it easy to verify operations and troubleshoot any issues.

### üóÇÔ∏è Basic Duplicate Management
When SnapSort encounters files with identical names in the destination folder, it performs intelligent duplicate handling:
- Compares SHA256 hash of both files if names match
- Skips the file if contents are identical
- Saves with timestamp appended if files differ (preserving both versions)

The script handles errors gracefully, including unreadable files, missing EXIF data, and permission issues, logging all errors for later review.

## üîß Enhanced Workflow Management

### üìù CSV Logging and Configuration
SnapSort generates detailed CSV logs that serve multiple purposes beyond simple record-keeping. These files contain complete configuration information embedded within them, making each log self-contained and portable. Config and filtering heuristics are saved in the CSV as a single cell in the second row, making it robust and spreadsheet-friendly.

When running in manual or resume mode, the script automatically reads all config values from the CSV and applies them, ensuring consistency across sessions. The system is future-proof - if new config items are added, the script will prompt for any missing values, maintaining compatibility with older CSV files.

### üîÑ Flexible Operation Modes
SnapSort offers three distinct operation modes to handle different scenarios:

- **Normal Copy:** Scans and processes all files according to current heuristics
- **Manual Copy:** Only copies files explicitly marked in the CSV (`copy_anyway == yes`), with destination paths reconstructed automatically using config from the CSV
- **Resume Copy:** Continues a previous operation by skipping files already listed in the CSV, reading and applying all config and heuristics from the existing file

## ‚öôÔ∏è How SnapSort Works

The script follows a systematic approach to ensure reliable and efficient processing:

1. **Initialization**
   - Scans the source directory for supported image files with animated spinner feedback
   - Loads config and heuristics from CSV if running in manual or resume mode

2. **Processing** - For each image:
   - Skips files in system/app folders or those too small
   - Checks for EXIF data using `piexif`/Pillow or `exiftool`
   - Includes large/high-res images even if EXIF is missing
   - Determines destination folder based on date
   - Performs duplicate checking with hash comparison
   - Copies file and logs the action

3. **Summary**
   - Prints and logs comprehensive operation statistics including counts, total size, errors, and duration

> **Note:** Log and CSV files are created in your current working directory, not necessarily alongside the script file. Make sure to ```cd``` into the correct directory!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [`Pillow`](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [`piexif`](https://pypi.org/project/piexif/)
- [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) (must be installed and in your PATH)

### üíª Usage
1. Set the `SOURCE_DIR` and `DEST_DIR` variables at the top of the script, or let the script prompt you
2. Run the script: `python3 photo_organizer.py`
3. Choose your desired operation mode
4. Review the generated `photo_organizer.log` and `photo_organizer.csv` files for details

### üéõÔ∏è Customization Options
You can easily customize SnapSort for your specific needs by modifying the constants at the top of the script. Change filtering heuristics like minimum size, resolution, or system folders to exclude. Add or remove supported image formats by editing the `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` tuple. New config items added to the script will be automatically handled in future CSV files.

## üîÄ Parallel Processing

You can run multiple instances of SnapSort simultaneously to process different folders or drives in parallel, which can significantly speed up large operations. However, there are important considerations:

- Multiple instances using the same destination folder or log/CSV files may create duplicate files (with timestamped names) and interleaved log entries
- For best results, use different destination and log/CSV files for each instance
- Directory creation and file copying are safe for concurrent use, but shared log/CSV files may be harder to read

**Tip:** Run one instance per source folder or drive, each with its own destination and log files for maximum speed and clarity.

## üîÆ Future Development

SnapSort continues to evolve with several enhancements considered:

- **Multi-threaded processing:** Add support for multi-threaded or multi-process file handling to increase speed, especially on fast SSDs
- **Improved deduplication:** More advanced solution to handle exact and near duplicates, with configurable speed vs. accuracy trade-offs
- **Faster hash comparison:** Limit SHA256 calculation to first 1KB of files for faster processing of large RAW images
- **Command-line arguments:** Allow configuration via command-line for easier automation
- **Automatic drive handling:** Notifications when drives finish, safe ejection, and auto-start when new drives connect
- **In-memory destination tree:** Faster duplicate detection through memory-cached folder structure
- **Project-level reporting:** Summary statistics across multiple drives or sessions
- **Analyze-only mode:** Build CSV without copying files for manual review and editing
- **Improved architecture:** Better Python structure with classes and modules for integration into other projects
